# Introduction
We are developing an innovative AI platform designed to transcend traditional boundaries. Our mission is to enable AI to interact seamlessly with any on-chain data across blockchain networks, unrestricted by limitations. This platform serves as a collaborative hub where users can create, share, and own AI tools, agents, and widgetsâ€”collectively advancing the capabilities of AI within the decentralized ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Smart Actions**: Simplify complex blockchain interactions using intuitive prompts. Execute tasks effortlessly, such as "Swap 1.2 NEAR for USDC" or "Stake 50 tokens in Linear", making Dapp protocols and smart contracts more accessible.
- **Collaborative Creation of AI Tools and Agents**: Empower users to develop their own AI tools and agents on our platform. By sharing these creations, the community collectively enhances the AI's ability to interact with diverse decentralized applications (dApps) and perform a wide range of on-chain tasks.
- **Customizable Widgets and Social Sharing**: Personalize your platform experience by creating and sharing widgets that display real-time data, AI outputs, or any concept you envision. Share your profile, widgets, and agents with others, fostering a vibrant social environment where innovation flourishes.
- **User-Owned AI Ecosystem**: Embrace the concept of User-Owned AI, where control and ownership of AI assets are decentralized. Users have the autonomy to shape the AI's development, ensuring it evolves according to the community's needs and values.

## The Vision of User-Owned AI
Our platform embodies the emerging paradigm of User-Owned AI, where users retain control over the AI systems they utilize. By decentralizing AI development and ownership, we prevent monopolization by large corporations and promote a more equitable digital landscape. This collaborative approach accelerates innovation, as collective contributions lead to rapid advancements in AI capabilities.
